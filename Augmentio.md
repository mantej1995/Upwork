# Augmentio

Augmentio is a python based application used for removing background and replacing it with images and videos.We have used only images in this. The foreground in the application is the person itself.We have used yolact_minimal model as our ML model.The files newdesg.py and eval.py are the main files we have edited (there are other python modules and deep learning model as well along with other files),newdesg.py is for the gui display which is made using pyqt5 designer  and eval.py contains the runner function which is used for running the application. Right now this app is without qr code.

## Installation
Right now we have a folder containing newdesg.py file and eval.py so this is not installable


## Usage
For using this application we use only newdesg.py file and which can be used by the following code.

python newdesg.py
